	 * mappings for other classes (you can define mappings for two different subclasses for example, but if you define a
	 * mapping for the parent class then that will take precedence - inheritance mapping isn't supported).
	 * <p>
	 * Each element of the fieldMapping array represents a CSV column to be written and uses the standard Dozer field
	 * mapping syntax. For example, if you were configuring the mappings for Person class you might define
	 * <code>firstName</code> as the first element (just a simple field mapping), <code>address.city</code> as the second
	 * element (a nested - or deep - field mapping), and
	 * <code>accounts[0].balance</code> as the third element (index based mapping).
	 * <p>
	 * If you require access to the other features of Dozer in your mappings (customer getters/setters, bean factories, custom converters), 
	 * then you should supply your own DozerBeanMapper to the Writer instead.
